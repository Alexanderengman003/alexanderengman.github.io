                                            <!-- <strong>Work description</strong><br>
                                            After three years of intensive development at Ascilion, I successfully led
                                            the product from its design phase to completion. My role then evolved to
                                            focus on integrating our innovative dISF extraction tool into diverse
                                            customer applications. This transition demanded a high level of customer
                                            interaction, requiring me to deeply understand and address complex customer
                                            needs while providing comprehensive support. My responsibilities expanded to
                                            include extensive travel, both domestically and internationally,
                                            representing Ascilion and our product.

                                            A significant achievement in this role was navigating the intricate world of
                                            medical device regulation (MDR). I spearheaded our compliance efforts,
                                            ensuring our product met stringent regulatory standards crucial for market
                                            entry. This involved a deep dive into complex regulatory frameworks,
                                            requiring me to quickly become an expert in an area that was initially
                                            unfamiliar to me.
                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>Regulatory compliance achievements</strong><br>
                                            Leveraging my in-depth knowledge of the product's development, I took charge
                                            of ensuring compliance with key industry standards. I successfully managed
                                            the compliance process for IEC 60601 (electrical safety) and IEC 62304
                                            (software life cycle processes). As the project manager for IEC 60601
                                            compliance, I orchestrated rigorous design and safety testing, maintaining
                                            continuous dialogue with testing bodies and expertly managing a complex web
                                            of requirements.

                                            This process involved coordinating with multiple departments within
                                            Ascilion, external consultants, and regulatory bodies. I had to ensure that
                                            every aspect of our product, from its electrical components to its software
                                            architecture, met the exacting standards required for medical devices. This
                                            often meant revisiting and refining aspects of our design, a process that
                                            required both technical expertise and diplomatic skills to balance
                                            regulatory requirements with practical considerations.

                                            A major accomplishment was developing a comprehensive risk management plan,
                                            which became a cornerstone of our regulatory strategy. This involved a
                                            systematic analysis of potential risks associated with our device, from
                                            electrical hazards to software malfunctions, and developing mitigation
                                            strategies for each. The plan I created not only satisfied regulatory
                                            requirements but also significantly enhanced the safety and reliability of
                                            our product.

                                            On the software front, I led the effort to align our product with IEC 62304
                                            standards, developing an exhaustive test plan and detailed requirements
                                            specification that significantly enhanced our product's reliability and
                                            market readiness. This involved a complete overhaul of our software
                                            development processes, implementing rigorous documentation practices, and
                                            establishing a robust system for tracking and resolving software issues
                                            throughout the product lifecycle.

                                            <strong>Business development and customer relations</strong><br>
                                            My role expanded into business development, particularly in Europe and the
                                            U.S. I not only trained customers on our device but also played a crucial
                                            role in understanding their unique needs and facilitating collaborations.
                                            This customer-centric approach led to several successful partnerships and
                                            product integrations across diverse fields.

                                            I took the initiative to develop tailored presentations and demonstrations
                                            for each potential client, showcasing how our technology could address their
                                            specific challenges. This often involved rapid learning about new fields and

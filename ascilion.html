                                            <strong>Work description</strong><br>
                                            After three years of intensive development at Ascilion, I successfully led
                                            the product from its design phase to completion. My role then evolved to
                                            focus on integrating our innovative dISF extraction tool into diverse
                                            customer applications. This transition demanded a high level of customer
                                            interaction, requiring me to deeply understand and address complex customer
                                            needs while providing comprehensive support. My responsibilities expanded to
                                            include extensive travel, both domestically and internationally,
                                            representing Ascilion and our product.

                                            A significant achievement in this role was navigating the intricate world of
                                            medical device regulation (MDR). I spearheaded our compliance efforts,
                                            ensuring our product met stringent regulatory standards crucial for market
                                            entry. This involved a deep dive into complex regulatory frameworks,
                                            requiring me to quickly become an expert in an area that was initially
                                            unfamiliar to me.
                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>Regulatory compliance achievements</strong><br>
                                            Leveraging my in-depth knowledge of the product's development, I took charge
                                            of ensuring compliance with key industry standards. I successfully managed
                                            the compliance process for IEC 60601 (electrical safety) and IEC 62304
                                            (software life cycle processes). As the project manager for IEC 60601
                                            compliance, I orchestrated rigorous design and safety testing, maintaining
                                            continuous dialogue with testing bodies and expertly managing a complex web
                                            of requirements.

                                            This process involved coordinating with multiple departments within
                                            Ascilion, external consultants, and regulatory bodies. I had to ensure that
                                            every aspect of our product, from its electrical components to its software
                                            architecture, met the exacting standards required for medical devices. This
                                            often meant revisiting and refining aspects of our design, a process that
                                            required both technical expertise and diplomatic skills to balance
                                            regulatory requirements with practical considerations.

                                            A major accomplishment was developing a comprehensive risk management plan,
                                            which became a cornerstone of our regulatory strategy. This involved a
                                            systematic analysis of potential risks associated with our device, from
                                            electrical hazards to software malfunctions, and developing mitigation
                                            strategies for each. The plan I created not only satisfied regulatory
                                            requirements but also significantly enhanced the safety and reliability of
                                            our product.

                                            On the software front, I led the effort to align our product with IEC 62304
                                            standards, developing an exhaustive test plan and detailed requirements
                                            specification that significantly enhanced our product's reliability and
                                            market readiness. This involved a complete overhaul of our software
                                            development processes, implementing rigorous documentation practices, and
                                            establishing a robust system for tracking and resolving software issues
                                            throughout the product lifecycle.

                                            <strong>Business development and customer relations</strong><br>
                                            My role expanded into business development, particularly in Europe and the
                                            U.S. I not only trained customers on our device but also played a crucial
                                            role in understanding their unique needs and facilitating collaborations.
                                            This customer-centric approach led to several successful partnerships and
                                            product integrations across diverse fields.

                                            I took the initiative to develop tailored presentations and demonstrations
                                            for each potential client, showcasing how our technology could address their
                                            specific challenges. This often involved rapid learning about new fields and
                                            applications, from biomarker analysis to drug development processes,
                                            allowing me to engage meaningfully with experts across various domains.

                                            real-world applications.

                                            One of my key projects involved developing a novel microneedle testing
                                            apparatus. This required me to design a system that could accurately measure
                                            the penetration force and structural integrity of our silicon microneedles,
                                            which are critical components of our dISF extraction device. I integrated
                                            force sensors, high-precision actuators, and a custom-designed fixture to
                                            hold the microneedles. The resulting system not only improved our quality
                                            control process but also provided valuable data for optimizing our
                                            microneedle design.

                                            In addition to the GUI, I developed a suite of data analysis tools that
                                            automated much of our research workflow. This included algorithms for
                                            processing raw sensor data, identifying key biomarkers, and generating
                                            comprehensive reports. These tools not only increased our research
                                            efficiency but also provided valuable insights that guided our product
                                            refinement process.

                                            My expertise in silicon wafer inspection, using techniques like SEM and LOM,
                                            was crucial in maintaining high product quality. I took the initiative to
                                            design and manufacture customized tools for these inspections, demonstrating
                                            my problem-solving skills and hands-on approach. One such tool was a custom
                                            stage for our SEM that allowed for high-throughput inspection of microneedle
                                            arrays, significantly speeding up our quality control process.

                                            Beyond technical development, I took on responsibilities in project
                                            management, product design, documentation, and customer support, showcasing
                                            my versatility and ability to manage multiple aspects of product development
                                            and deployment. I led several cross-functional teams, coordinating efforts
                                            between our engineering, biology, and manufacturing departments to ensure
                                            smooth product development and timely delivery.
                                            <br><br>
                                            <strong>What I learned in this role:</strong><br>
                                            This role was a transformative experience, significantly expanding my
                                            technical and professional skill set. I gained comprehensive knowledge in
                                            medical device development, from initial concept to market-ready product. My
                                            self-taught journey in software development, particularly in creating
                                            complex, integrated systems, was a major personal achievement. The
                                            experience in CAD (Solidworks), 3D printing, and microfluidics broadened my
                                            expertise in cutting-edge manufacturing techniques.

                                            Working in a startup environment honed my ability to manage multiple
                                            responsibilities efficiently and make critical decisions in a fast-paced
                                            setting. I learned to prioritize tasks effectively, balance short-term
                                            deliverables with long-term goals, and adapt quickly to changing project
                                            requirements.

                                            This role also deepened my understanding of the interdisciplinary nature of
                                            medical device development. I learned to effectively communicate and
                                            collaborate with professionals from diverse backgrounds, including
                                            engineers, biologists, regulatory experts, and clinicians. This experience
                                            has made me a more well-rounded professional, capable of bridging the gap
                                            between different specialties and driving innovation in complex,
                                            multidisciplinary projects.
